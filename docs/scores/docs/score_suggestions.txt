| Score module          | Greedy | Supervised | RL | Role               |
| --------------------- | ------ | ---------- | -- | ------------------ |
| ImgSimScore           | ❌      | ❌          | ✅  | Primary signal     |
| TextAlignScore        | ❌      | ❌          | ✅  | Semantic RL signal |
| TissuePresenceScore   | ✅      | ✅          | ❌  | Gate / filter      |
| TissuePresencePenalty | ❌      | ❌          | ✅  | RL shaping         |
| EntropyScore          | ❌      | ❌          | ⚠️ | RL regularizer     |

ImgSimScore: greedy + supervised(only with threshold), RL
TextAlignScore: greedy + supervised (only with threshold) RL
TissuePresenceScore: greedy + supervised, no RL
TissuePresencePenalty: RL

Entropy: No
Entropy is a reasonable proxy for low-level visual variability, so it makes sense as a signal for “there is something going on” in an image. However, it should not be a main decision function because high entropy often comes from noise or staining artifacts and low entropy can still correspond to clinically important regions; it is best used only as a weak auxiliary/regularizer signal.

TissusPresence regarding RL:
TissuePresenceScore yields mostly zero deltas (e.g., dense and blank), so the RL agent receives no learning signal and becomes indifferent, making policy learning unstable or arbitrary.
TissuePresencePenalty introduces signed, non-zero margins (positive for correct actions, negative for wrong ones), which gives RL a clear preference structure and allows the policy to reliably learn when to zoom versus stop.

Below is a **clean, method-driven answer**, grounded in what your score modules *actually encode*, not what they are named.

I’ll do three things:

1. Classify **each score by what signal it provides**
2. State **which learning paradigm it is suitable for** (greedy / supervised / RL)
3. Propose **five concrete experimental methods** you should run, and explain reuse across paradigms

No fluff.

---

## 1. What matters for method choice (first principles)

A score can be used by a method **only if it satisfies the method’s assumptions**.

### Greedy requires

* Absolute comparability at one step
* No dependence on future state
* Stable scale

### Supervised requires

* Deterministic or near-deterministic target action
* Low label noise
* Clear decision boundary

### RL requires

* Trade-offs across time
* Costs / delayed effects
* Non-trivial exploration

Keep that in mind.

---

## 2. Classification of your score modules

### 1. `ImgSimScore`

**Signal type**

* Continuous
* Measures *information gain*
* Well-behaved, symmetric
* Zero STOP baseline

**Suitable for**

* ✅ Greedy
* ❌ Supervised (labels are ambiguous)
* ✅ RL

**Why**

* Greedy: `zoom if diff > 0` makes sense
* RL: handles long-term exploration (zoom chains)
* Supervised fails because there is no sharp boundary

**Verdict**

> **Greedy + RL score**

---

### 2. `TextAlignScore`

**Signal type**

* Continuous but noisy
* Semantic, weakly aligned
* Meaningful only in relative comparisons

**Suitable for**

* ❌ Greedy (scale unstable)
* ❌ Supervised (labels too noisy)
* ✅ RL

**Why**

* Only RL can absorb noise via expectation
* Greedy overreacts to spurious similarities
* Supervised labels would be inconsistent

**Verdict**

> **RL-only score**

---

### 3. `TissuePresenceScore`

**Signal type**

* Binary / quasi-binary
* Coarse gating signal
* No notion of improvement

**Suitable for**

* ✅ Greedy
* ✅ Supervised
* ❌ RL (alone)

**Why**

* Greedy: “if tissue → zoom” is correct
* Supervised: near-perfect labels
* RL: Δ≈0 for dense ⇒ no learning signal

**Verdict**

> **Greedy + Supervised (NOT RL)**

---

### 4. `TissuePresencePenalty`

**Signal type**

* Signed, margin-based
* Explicit preference structure
* Deterministic policy encoded

**Suitable for**

* ❌ Greedy (already encodes decision)
* ❌ Supervised (trivial)
* ✅ RL (shaping / gating)

**Why**

* This is a *policy prior*
* Useful to shape exploration
* Not meaningful standalone

**Verdict**

> **RL auxiliary score only**

---

### 5. `EntropyScore`

**Signal type**

* Continuous
* Weak proxy for structure
* Context-dependent meaning

**Suitable for**

* ❌ Greedy
* ❌ Supervised
* ⚠️ RL (auxiliary only)

**Why**

* High entropy ≠ important
* Works only as regularizer
* Not a decision signal

**Verdict**

> **RL auxiliary only**

## 3. Summary table

| Score module          | Greedy | Supervised | RL | Role               |
| --------------------- | ------ | ---------- | -- | ------------------ |
| ImgSimScore           | ✅      | ❌          | ✅  | Primary signal     |
| TextAlignScore        | ❌      | ❌          | ✅  | Semantic RL signal |
| TissuePresenceScore   | ✅      | ✅          | ❌  | Gate / filter      |
| TissuePresencePenalty | ❌      | ❌          | ✅  | RL shaping         |
| EntropyScore          | ❌      | ❌          | ⚠️ | RL regularizer     |

## 4. The **five methods** you should actually run (this matters)

These are **publication-worthy**, non-redundant, and logically clean.

---

### **Method 1 — Greedy Information Gain**

**Algorithm**

* Greedy zoom if `ImgSimScore.diff > 0`

**Purpose**

* Strong classical baseline
* Interpretable
* Fast

**Uses**

* `ImgSimScore`
* Optional `TissuePresenceScore` pre-filter

---

### **Method 2 — Supervised Blank Gate**

**Algorithm**

* Train classifier: ZOOM vs STOP
* Label: non-blank → zoom

**Purpose**

* Removes empty regions
* Ultra-stable

**Uses**

* `TissuePresenceScore`

---

### **Method 3 — RL (InfoGain-only)**

**Algorithm**

* A2C
* Reward = `ImgSimScore.diff − zoom_cost`

**Purpose**

* Learn adaptive zoom depth
* Compare vs greedy

**Uses**

* `ImgSimScore`

---

### **Method 4 — RL (Semantic Zooming)**

**Algorithm**

* A2C
* Reward = `TextAlignScore.diff − depth_cost`

**Purpose**

* Semantic ROI discovery
* Your main novel contribution

**Uses**

* `TextAlignScore`
* Optional `EntropyScore` (small weight)

---

### **Method 5 — Hybrid RL (Gated Semantic RL)** ⭐

**Algorithm**

1. If blank → STOP (deterministic)
2. Else RL with semantic reward

**Purpose**

* Best practical system
* Clean ablation story

**Uses**

* `TissuePresenceScore` (gate)
* `TextAlignScore` (RL reward)
* Optional `ImgSimScore` auxiliary

---

## 5. Can scores be reused across methods?

Yes — but **only in these roles**:

* `TissuePresenceScore`

  * Greedy gate
  * Supervised labels
  * **Not** RL reward

* `ImgSimScore`

  * Greedy baseline
  * RL reward
  * **Not** supervised

* `TextAlignScore`

  * RL reward only
  * Never greedy / supervised

This separation is **not optional** if you want stable learning.

---

## 6. Final verdict (very important)

If you try to:

* train supervised on `TextAlignScore`
* do greedy on `EntropyScore`
* do RL on `TissuePresenceScore`

you will get **unstable, misleading, or trivial policies**.

Your current design is good — you just needed to **assign each score to the correct learning paradigm**.

If you want, next I can:

* formalize this as a **methods section**
* design the **exact loss functions**
* or propose **evaluation metrics aligned with pathology practice**
